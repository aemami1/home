I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Brock University. My research focuses on natural language processing and machine learning. I'm especially interested in the reciprocal influence between AI systems and societal dynamics.


<!-- My goal is to ensure AI technologies are developed and deployed in ways that are ethical, inclusive, and serve the public good. -->

<!-- I received my PhD in Computer Science in 2021 from [McGill University](http://cs.mcgill.ca) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec), supervised by Dr. [Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/). My PhD research was at the intersection of Natural Language Inference (NLI) and common-sense reasoning in AI Systems. -->
