I'm an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science at Brock University. My broad interests are in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing with a recent primary focus on addressing the generalizability, interpretability, and ethical implications of large language models (LLMs). Through this, I'm aiming to contribute to the responsible and efficient development of AI technologies in the future.

I received my PhD in Computer Science in 2021 from [McGill University](http://cs.mcgill.ca) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec), supervised by Dr. [Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/). My PhD research was at the intersection of Natural Language Inference (NLI) and common-sense reasoning in AI Systems.
