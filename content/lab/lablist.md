# Research 

The Brock NLP lab is dedicated to developing **trustworthy, generalizable, transparent, and fair** natural language processing tools capable of understanding, reasoning, and producing human-like text. Our research spans multiple facets of AI, with a particular focus on three key areas:

### 1. Bias Detection and Mitigation in Large Language Models (LLMs)

We develop innovative methods to identify and address subtle biases in LLMs, aiming to create more equitable AI systems. Our work introduces novel metrics and evaluation frameworks to measure representative and affinity biases that often go unnoticed.

{{< figure src="/uploads/debiasing.png" caption="Framework checklist comparing the consistency of recent debiasing methods.  [Read more about this study](/publication/morabito-2023-debiasing/).">}}

**Key Contributions:**
- Introduced the Representative Bias Score (RBS) and Affinity Bias Score (ABS) to measure subtle biases in LLMs.
- Developed the Creativity-Oriented Generation Suite (CoGS) for detecting biases in open-ended tasks.
- Proposed a protocol for measuring the consistency of debiasing techniques in language models.

**Recent Publications:**

- Morabito, R., Kabbara, J., Emami, A. (2023). Debiasing should be Good and Bad: Measuring the Consistency of Debiasing Techniques in Language Models. In *Findings of ACL 2023*.

### 2. Reasoning and Benchmarking of LLMs

We create innovative challenges and datasets to rigorously test the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, with a particular focus on enhancing and expanding the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC).

{{< figure src="/uploads/winovis.jpg" caption="A representative output from Stable Diffusion 2.0 on a WINOVIS instance. The Diffusion Attentive Attribution Maps (DAAM) clarify the model’s focus for different terms and the correctness of its interpretation: correctly identifying ‘bee’ and ‘flower’ but erroneously associating ‘it’ with the bee instead of the flower.

**Key Contributions:**
- Developed WinoVis, a novel dataset for probing text-to-image models on pronoun disambiguation in multimodal contexts.
- Created EvoGrad, an open-source platform for dynamic WSC datasets using a human-in-the-loop approach.
- Introduced WSC+, an enhanced version of the WSC using a Tree-of-Experts approach.

### 3. Machine Interpretability and Confidence Analysis

We investigate the inner workings of LLMs, focusing on their confidence-probability alignment and decision-making processes to enhance their reliability and interpretability.

{{< figure src="/uploads/confidence.png" caption="Flow diagram illustrating the process of extracting and comparing the Internal Confidence and Verbalized Certainty in an LLM. [Read more about this study](/publication/kumar-2024-confidence/).">}}


**Key Contributions:**
- Introduced the concept of Confidence-Probability Alignment in LLMs.
- Developed novel prompting techniques to encourage model introspection and self-evaluation.
- Proposed a framework for assessing model stability in dynamic tasks through the error depth metric.

**Recent Publication:**
- Kumar, A., Morabito, R., Umbet, S., Kabbara, J., Emami, A. (2024). Confidence Under the Hood: An Investigation into the Confidence-Probability Alignment in Large Language Models. In *Proceedings of ACL 2024*.

We are dedicated to advancing the development of more reliable, unbiased, and interpretable language models, with our work regularly presented at conferences such as ACL, COLING-LREC, and EACL.

We are recruiting new graduate students for Fall, 2024

**Undergraduates:** Please don't hesitate to email me to inquire about research projects that I (or better, yet, you) may have in mind. Please also attach your transcript as well as a brief description of which areas of my research interests (e.g., natural language processing) you would like to work on and why. I highly encourage, and prefer, students that are planning on a summer internship (under the NSERC USRA or SURA program), or are planning to do an Honour's thesis. 

**Graduates:** M.Sc. (<font color="blue">Computer Science</font>) and PhD (<font color="blue">Intelligent Systems and Data Science</font>) admissions are handled centrally in our department. Please see [this](https://brocku.ca/graduate-studies/future-students/apply/) page for application instructions.
