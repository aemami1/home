# Research 

The primary research objective of the Brock NLP lab is to create **trustworthy, controllable, and safe** natural language processing tools that can understand, reason, and produce human-like texts. Our research encompasses multiple facets of AI, including bias detection and mitigation, reasoning and benchmarking of Large Language Models (LLMs), and machine interpretability.

### 1. Bias Detection and Mitigation in LLMs
We focus on developing subtle measures to evaluate representative and affinity bias in Large Language Models. Our research aims to create more equitable AI systems by identifying and addressing hidden biases.

### 2. Reasoning and Benchmarking LLMs
Our work in this area involves creating innovative challenges and datasets to test the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, with a particular focus on the Winograd Schema Challenge.

### 3. Machine Interpretability
We investigate the inner workings of Large Language Models, focusing on their confidence-probability alignment and other aspects of their decision-making processes.

# Join Us

We are recruiting new graduate students for Fall, 2024

**Undergraduates:** Please don't hesitate to email me to inquire about research projects that I (or better, yet, you) may have in mind. Please also attach your transcript as well as a brief description of which areas of my research interests (e.g., natural language processing) you would like to work on and why. I highly encourage, and prefer, students that are planning on a summer internship (under the NSERC USRA or SURA program), or are planning to do an Honour's thesis. 

**Graduates:** M.Sc. (<font color="blue">Computer Science</font>) and PhD (<font color="blue">Intelligent Systems and Data Science</font>) admissions are handled centrally in our department. Please see [this](https://brocku.ca/graduate-studies/future-students/apply/) page for application instructions.
