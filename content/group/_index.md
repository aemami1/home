# Join My  Group at Emory CS

I am recruiting **fully funded PhD students** for the **Fall 2026** cohort (applications due October 2025), as well as **MS students** interested in thesis research. I'm building a new interdisciplinary research group at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing**, **AI Fairness**, and **Human-Centered AI**. 

We develop methods to make AI systems more **fair, robust, and reliable** while understanding their limitations and societal impacts. Current research directions include:

- **Reasoning & Evaluation:** Creating challenging benchmarks that push AI reasoning capabilities and reveal failure modes  
- **Interpretability:** Opening the black box of AI systems to understand their decision-making and build trust
- **Bias & Safety:** Detecting and mitigating biases in language models, with focus on culturally-aware and context-dependent definitions of harm
- **Applied AI for Good:** Leveraging AI for inclusive education, diverse storytelling, and equitable technology

## What We Offer at Emory

**World-class institution, Atlanta advantage.** Emory is a top private R1 university (#24 US News) with abundant resources and a rapidly rising CS department.

**Interdisciplinary opportunities.** Emory's strengths in medicine, public health, business, and liberal arts create unique collaboration opportunities for AI research with real-world impact.

**Fresh start, ground floor opportunity.** As I'm establishing this new lab, my first students will help shape our culture and research directions. You'll receive extensive mentorship and have the chance to be a founding member of an exciting new research group.

**Visible impact.** We target top-tier venues (ACL, EMNLP, NeurIPS, AAAI, ICML, CHI) and create tools/datasets that the community actually uses. Our work addresses pressing societal challenges in AI fairness and safety.

**Balanced mentorship.** I maintain a supportive, collaborative environment with regular 1-on-1s, hands-on guidance, and respect for work-life balance. Your success is my success.
