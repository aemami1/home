# Join Our Research Group at Emory

I am recruiting **fully funded PhD students** for **Fall 2026** (applications due December 2025), as well as **MS students** interested in thesis research. I'm building a new interdisciplinary research group at the intersection of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **AI Safety**, **Human-Centered AI**, and **AI4Health**.

## Research Focus

We develop methods to make AI systems more **trustworthy, reliable, and equitable**, while understanding their limitations and societal impacts. Current research directions include:

- **Reasoning & Evaluation:** Creating challenging benchmarks that push AI reasoning capabilities and reveal failure modes  
- **AI Safety & Fairness:** Developing methods to identify and mitigate harmful behaviors in language models, with a focus on culturally-aware and context-dependent definitions of harm  
- **Reliability & Robustness:** Stress-testing AI systems across diverse conditions and ensuring consistent performance in real-world settings  
- **Interpretability:** Opening the black box of AI systems to understand their decision-making and build human trust  
- **Applied AI for Good:** Leveraging AI for inclusive education, diverse storytelling, equitable healthcare, and socially beneficial applications  

## Current Team

### Director
Ali Emami, Assistant Professor of Computer Science
