Prerequisites 2. Create source repository 3. Set up initial website 4. Create and set up host repository 5. Automatically publish changes in source repository on your website 6. Where to go from here This post describes how one can set up a personal website using the Hugo Academic theme for the static site generator Hugo and publish it automatically with GitHub Pages. It is targeted towards readers who have a basic understanding of how to use git from the command line and who already have a GitHub account. This post is based on Hugo Extended 0.73.0 and Hugo Academic 0.49, which were the respective latest releases at the time of writing (July 2020).\nThe final goal will be to have two GitHub repositories: a source repository that contains the website\u0026rsquo;s unprocessed resources and a host repository that hosts the the generated website. We will use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy from the source to the host repository, i.e., if a change to the website is commited and pushed to the source repository, our GitHub Actions setup will auto-generate the actual website with Hugo and create a new commit on the host repository.\n1. Prerequisites As stated above, you need to have a GitHub account and at least some familiarity with using git from the command line. Furthermore, you also need to install Hugo on your machine, such that you can build and test your website locally before deploying it. The easiest way to set up Hugo is to download and unpack the latest release from the Hugo releases website on GitHub. For more information on installing Hugo, refer to the official installation instructions.\nMake sure you install the extended version of Hugo, which is required to build the Hugo Academic theme. 2. Create source repository As a first step, we will create a new source repository on GitHub. It will hold your website\u0026rsquo;s unprocessed sources, from which the website\u0026rsquo;s HTML documents will be built. The official docs recommend to fork the Academic Kickstart repository. However, this prevents you from making your source repository private, which is why I decided to take a different route and manually duplicate the Academic Kickstart repository to my GitHub account:\nCreate a new repository on GitHub, e.g., academic-kickstart. You can safely make it private, but do not initialize it with at README. In this post, I will call the source repository academic-kickstart-demo and it is available here.\nClone the Academic Kickstart repository from https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart, replace the URL of origin with your source repository\u0026rsquo;s URL, and push it to GitHub:\ngit clone git@github.com:sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git academic-kickstart-demo cd academic-kickstart-demo git remote set-url origin git@github.com:sloede/academic-kickstart-demo.git git push Make sure to replace the URL of the source repository with your own!\n3. Set up initial website Before proceeding to make modifications, you should have a look at the initial state of the website and verify that everything works. To do this, you first need to initialize the git submodules by running\ngit submodule update --init --recursive This step is required once after you clone your source repository to a new location, as it will download necessary files for the Hugo Academic theme to work. Then, you can build your website locally by executing hugo, which will generate the website and place all files in the public/ directory. Alternatively, you can also start a local webserver with\nhugo server which will build the website and make it available at http://localhost:1313. In this mode Hugo will automatically re-generate your site whenever you change your sources, which comes in handy while developing your contents. Initial state of the website before any modifications. Now it is time to set up the initial website. A full description of what to do can be found in the official Getting Started guide. The most important files to configure your website are the following:\nconfig/_default/config.toml: Overall website configuration. config/_default/params.toml: Parameters for individual features. config/_default/menus.toml: Configure main navigation bar. content/authors/admin/_index.md: Details about the main user (you!). Due to extensive inline documentation, all files are more or less self-explaining. The content/ subfolder contains all user-editable source files from which the website is built. For the initial setup, disable all sections on the main homepage for which you do not have created your own content yet by either deleting them from content/home or by moving them to a different folder.\nHere is a short todo list to help you set up initially. To see the respective changes in the academic-kickstart-demo repository, click on the linked git commit:\nEdit config/_default/config.toml and change title to your website\u0026rsquo;s title (diff). Edit config/_default/params.toml and make the following modifications (diff): Disable edit_page by commenting it out (prepend with #). Edit the contact details like email, phone etc. Everything you do not need, you can just comment out by prepending a # symbol. Disable showing a map by setting engine to 0 in the [map] section. Disable unused widgets on the homepage by executing git mv content/home content/home-unused mkdir content/home git mv content/home-unused/index.md content/home/ git mv content/home-unused/about.md content/home/ git mv content/home-unused/contact.md content/home/ and edit config/_default/menus.toml and comment out the entries for Posts, Projects, and Publications (diff). Update the main user (diff): Rename the folder content/author/admin to your name, replacing spaces by dashes and keeping everything lowercase: git mv content/authors/admin content/authors/carl-friedrich-gauss Edit content/authors/carl-friedrich-gauss/_index.md and enter your information. Most importantly, change the username under authors: from admin to your new username (= folder name under content/authors/), e.g., carl-friedrich-gauss. Edit content/home/about.md and change author from admin to your new username. Use hugo/hugo server to verify that everything is set up correctly (even if most useful content is still missing) and git push the source repository to GitHub.\n4. Create and set up host repository GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites on GitHub, which is ideal for websites generated with a static site generator such as Hugo. For each project (= repository) you have on GitHub, the corresponding GitHub pages website will be available under\nhttps://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.com/YOUR-PROJECT-NAME For the special project name YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.com, the website will be served directly under\nhttps://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.com That is, without the project name suffix. For example, for my GitHub user account sloede, the special project name is sloede.github.com and the website is available under https://sloede.github.com (this will actually redirect you to this website).\nIn this tutorial, we will use academic-pages-demo as the host repository name, since my canonical repository name sloede.github.com is obviously already taken. Go to GitHub and create a new repository, in my case academic-pages-demo. As per the documentation, your host repository needs to be public unless you are on a GitHub Pro account. This time, also tick the box to initialize the repository with a README for testing purposes. On your newly created host repository site, go to Settings, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and select master branch as your website source. Please note that in my case the URL differs from what you will see since I have already set up a custom domain for my GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages settings to select which branch to serve as a website. It is also advisable to tick the box Enforce HTTPS, since SSL-encrypted website connections are the norm nowadays.\nNow your host repository\u0026rsquo;s content (currently only the README file) will be available online and you can make sure that everything works by clicking on the link in the green box: Initial GitHub Pages website showing the README file. Before we proceed to auto-deploy your website, we will quickly verify that the GitHub Pages displays the Hugo Academic website properly. To do this, perform the following steps:\nDelete the existing public/ folder in your local clone of the source repository and clone your host repository as the public/ subfolder: rm -rf public/ git clone git@github.com:sloede/academic-pages-demo.git public Rebuild website: hugo Remove the README.md file (as otherwise your website will not be shown), add all files in public/ to git, and commit \u0026amp; push: cd public git rm README.md git add . git ci -m 'Initial commit of Hugo Academic website' git push cd .. When you go to the GitHub Pages URL of your host repository, the website should now look something like this: GitHub Pages website showing Hugo Academic website. Congratulations, your initial website is now online! To avoid accidental manual commits to the host repository, especially after we have set up automatic deployment in the next section, delete the .git folder from the public/ subdirectory:\nrm -rf public/.git 5. Automatically publish changes in source repository on your website As the last step, we will enable the automatic deployment from your source repository to your host repository. That is, whenever you push changes to your website to the source repository, we want to automatically update the host repository - and thus the actual website - as well. Since we created two separate repositories for the website\u0026rsquo;s sources and its processed files, we first need to create a deploy key to allow the source repository to automatically update the host repository. Following the instructions for creating a deploy key at https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages, you need to perform the following steps:\nGenerate an SSH key pair by executing ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \u0026quot;$(git config user.email)\u0026quot; -f gh-pages -N \u0026quot;\u0026quot; This will create two files: the public key gh-pages.pub and the private key gh-pages. Go to the repository settings of the source repository (here: academic-kickstart-demo), go to Secrets, and add a new secret with the name ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY (spelled exactly like this) and the contents of your secret key file gh-pages as the value: Add SSH secret key as new secret ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY to source repository. Go to the repository settings of the host repository (here: academic-pages-demo), go to Deploy Keys, and add a new deploy key with the title ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY (academic-kickstart-demo) and the contents of your public key file gh-pages.pub as the value. Make sure that the box for Allow write access is checked, as otherwise the source repository will not be able to update the host repository: Add SSH public key as new deploy key to host repository. Unlike for the newly added secret in the source repository, the exact title of the deploy key is not relevant for the automated deployment to work, but I recommend a descriptive name that reveals its purpose. After you have added the secret and the deploy key to the source and host repositories, you should delete the SSH key files, as their contents will not be needed again (and in case of the secret key, it is a security issue to leave it around): rm gh-pages gh-pages.pub With the deploy key in place, we can proceed to automatically update the host repository whenever a commit is pushed to the source repository. For this purpose, we will use GitHub Actions and create a workflow file that checks out the source repository, builds the website using Hugo, and adds the generated files to a new commit to the host repository.\nGo to your local clone of the source repository and create the GitHub Actions workflows directory:\nmkdir -p .github/workflows Next, create a new workflow file in .github/workflows, e.g., .github/workflows/GitHubPages.yml, with the following content:\nname: GitHub Pages on: push: branches: - master jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-20.04 steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 with: submodules: true # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive) # fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: '0.73.0' extended: true - name: Build run: hugo --minify - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: deploy_key: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY }} publish_dir: ./public publish_branch: master # deploying branch cname: academic-pages-demo.lakemper.eu allow_empty_commit: true external_repository: sloede/academic-pages-demo Here, I will briefly explain each part of the file so you know what it does:\nSet name of this workflow to identify it on GitHub. name: GitHub Pages Execute this workflow whenever someone pushes to master: on: push: branches: - master Run a deploy job with a number of steps to execute (will be described below). Execute the job on a virtual machine running Ubuntu 20.04. jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-20.04 steps: [...] A list of available virtual machines can be found in the GitHub documentation. I recommend to use a machine as close as possible to your personal system to avoid surprises. Check out the source repository using one of the GitHub-provided \u0026ldquo;actions\u0026rdquo;, which is just a fancy term for a script specifically written to be run in GitHub workflows. - uses: actions/checkout@v2 with: submodules: true # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive) # fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod Download and install Hugo using the peaceiris/actions-hugo action. The extended version of Hugo is required for the Hugo Academic theme to work, and I recommend to use the same Hugo version number as you use locally. - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: '0.73.0' extended: true Build the website and minify, i.e., try to reduce the website file size. By default, Hugo will place the resulting files in the public/ subdirectory. - name: Build run: hugo --minify Deploy the built website to your host repository using the peaceiris/actions-gh-pages action. The value of deploy_key must match the secret key name you used before, here it is called ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY. The publish_dir must match the directory to which hugo writes its generated files (default: public/). The publish_branch is the same branch that you selected above when you set up the host repository. cname should be set to the custom domain name you serve your GitHub Pages from, and can be omitted if no custom domain is configured. With allow_empty_commit, any push to the source repository will trigger a new commit to the host repository, even if there were no user-visible changes. The external_repository must be the name of your host repository on GitHub, i.e., its web URL without the https://github.com/ part. - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: deploy_key: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY }} publish_dir: ./public publish_branch: master # deploying branch cname: academic-pages-demo.lakemper.eu allow_empty_commit: true external_repository: sloede/academic-pages-demo Once the workflow file is in place, add, commit \u0026amp; push it to the source repository:\ngit add .github/workflows/GitHubPages.yml git ci -m 'Add workflow to automatically deploy website' git push The corresponding commit to the academic-kickstart-demo repository can be found here. You can verify that the workflow succeeded by going to your source repository website on GitHub - next to the latest commit info should be a small green checkmark: This workflow succeeded without errors. If you see a small brown circle instead of the checkmark, your action is still running. If the workflow indicator is a red cross, however, it means that something went wrong.\nSimilarly, you can check the host repository for a new commit, which will reference the commit to the source repository from which the current website was built: Automatically created commit on the host repository. 6. Where to go from here If everything went smoothly, you now have your own website online, generated from the Hugo Academic theme and auto-deployed to GitHub Pages. Your immediate next steps should be to update your user information (such that the dummy text provided by the academic-kickstart repository can be thrown out). Then, you can successively build up your personal website by either following the Hugo Academic documentation or by just experimenting. Always remember to only ever commit to the source repository directly, since manual commits to the host repository will be overwritten by the next automatic deployment.\nOnce your basic site is up and running, you can consider more advanced steps such as configuring a custom domain, adding support for comments as described here, or customizing the theme.\n","date":1594536673,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719653759,"objectID":"94f77c3ef183421a39f57970df6535ba","permalink":"https://aemami.ca/blog/getting-started-with-hugo-academic-and-github-pages/","publishdate":"2020-07-12T06:51:13Z","relpermalink":"/blog/getting-started-with-hugo-academic-and-github-pages/","section":"blog","summary":"How to set up a personal website with Hugo Academic and auto-deploy to GitHub Pages","tags":[],"title":"Getting Started With Hugo Academic and Github Pages","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Ali Emami","Adam Trischler","Kaheer Suleman","Jackie Chi Kit Cheung"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719683358,"objectID":"c9ca6a854c65533b532bc311f3384a4d","permalink":"https://aemami.ca/publication/emami-2020-analysis/","publishdate":"2024-06-28T23:12:02.207272Z","relpermalink":"/publication/emami-2020-analysis/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"An analysis of dataset overlap on winograd-style tasks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ali Emami","Adam Trischler","Kaheer Suleman","Jackie Chi Kit Cheung"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719683358,"objectID":"7aa81bb86b208a69702a90619c914faf","permalink":"https://aemami.ca/publication/emami-2018-generalized/","publishdate":"2024-06-28T23:12:02.177954Z","relpermalink":"/publication/emami-2018-generalized/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A generalized knowledge hunting framework for the winograd schema challenge","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ali Emami","Noelia De La Cruz","Adam Trischler","Kaheer Suleman","Jackie Chi Kit Cheung"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719683358,"objectID":"8c1160bf543e98fed85ca4c9a9f0344c","permalink":"https://aemami.ca/publication/emami-2018-knowledge/","publishdate":"2024-06-28T23:12:02.183826Z","relpermalink":"/publication/emami-2018-knowledge/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A knowledge hunting framework for common sense reasoning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Trichelair","Ali Emami","Adam Trischler","Kaheer Suleman","Jackie Chi Kit Cheung"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719683358,"objectID":"45d31dc4dcad8eca7f64eceb0d8a8e92","permalink":"https://aemami.ca/publication/trichelair-2018-reasonable/","publishdate":"2024-06-28T23:12:02.195514Z","relpermalink":"/publication/trichelair-2018-reasonable/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"How reasonable are common-sense reasoning tasks: A case-study on the Winograd schema challenge and SWAG","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ali Emami","Paul Trichelair","Adam Trischler","Kaheer Suleman","Hannes Schulz","Jackie Chi Kit Cheung"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719683358,"objectID":"2f7f78c92333966e94cb49a78dc460b9","permalink":"https://aemami.ca/publication/emami-2018-knowref/","publishdate":"2024-06-28T23:12:02.189647Z","relpermalink":"/publication/emami-2018-knowref/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The KnowRef coreference corpus: Removing gender and number cues for difficult pronominal anaphora resolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" [06/2024] Honored to receive the 2024 Faculty of Mathematics and Science Excellence in Teaching Award.\n[05/2024] 3 out of 3 submitted papers accepted at the main conference at The 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2024, August 11-16).

Our research encompasses multiple facets of AI, including bias detection and mitigation, reasoning and benchmarking of Large Language Models (LLMs), and machine interpretability.\n1. Bias Detection and Mitigation in LLMs We focus on developing subtle measures to evaluate representative and affinity bias in Large Language Models. Our research aims to create more equitable AI systems by identifying and addressing hidden biases.\nRelated papers:\nKumar, A., Yunusov, S., Emami, A. Subtle Biases Need Subtler Measures: Dual Metrics for Evaluating Representative and Affinity Bias in Large Language Models.

In Findings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2023) 2. Reasoning and Benchmarking LLMs Our work in this area involves creating innovative challenges and datasets to test the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, with a particular focus on the Winograd Schema Challenge.\nRelated papers:\nPark, B., Janecek, M., Li, Y., Emami, A.

Our research encompasses multiple facets of AI, including bias detection and mitigation, reasoning and benchmarking of Large Language Models (LLMs), and machine interpretability.\n1. Bias Detection and Mitigation in LLMs We focus on developing subtle measures to evaluate representative and affinity bias in Large Language Models. Our research aims to create more equitable AI systems by identifying and addressing hidden biases.\nRelated papers:\nKumar, A., Yunusov, S., Emami, A. Subtle Biases Need Subtler Measures: Dual Metrics for Evaluating Representative and Affinity Bias in Large Language Models.

In Findings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2023)\n2. Reasoning and Benchmarking LLMs Our work in this area involves creating innovative challenges and datasets to test the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, with a particular focus on the Winograd Schema Challenge.\nRelated papers:\nPark, B., Janecek, M., Li, Y., Emami, A.
