Blocked randomisation (size of four) with a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio was computer generated.

For the pooled analysis (single vs dual hormone), the median (interquartile range) percentage time spent at glucose levels below 4.0 mmol/l was 11% (0.0-46.7%) vs 0% (0-0%; p = 0.0001) and at glucose levels between 4.0 and 10.0 mmol/l was 71.4% (53.2-100%) vs 100% (100-100%; p = 0.003). Higher doses of glucagon were needed during continuous (0.126 ± 0.057 mg) than during interval exercise (0.093 ± 0.068 mg) (p = 0.03), with no reported side-effects in all interventions. <br> **Conclusions/interpretation**: The dual-hormone artificial pancreas outperformed the single-hormone artificial pancreas in regulating glucose levels during announced exercise in adults with type 1 diabetes."><link rel=alternate hreflang=en-us href=https://ali-emami.com/publication/taleb-2016-efficacy/><link rel=preconnect href=https://fonts.gstatic.com crossorigin><meta name=theme-color content="#4caf50"><script src=https://ali-emami.com/js/mathjax-config.js></script>
